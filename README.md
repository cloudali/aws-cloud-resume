#  Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my web resume repository! I built a web app for my resume on AWS using cloud infrastructure and automated it as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge. 

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed by Forrest Brazeal to help newbies bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.
